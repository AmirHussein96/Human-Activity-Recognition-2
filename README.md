Overview:
---------
Every modern Smart Phone has a number of sensors.we are interested in two of the sensors Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
**Accelerometers** detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration, as a vector quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes)<br>
**GyroScope** maintains orientation along a axis so that the orientation is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum.<br>

are used so that screens are always displayed upright and the phone has a sense of orientation.
