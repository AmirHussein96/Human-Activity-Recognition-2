Overview:
---------
Every modern Smart Phone has a number of sensors.we are interested in two of the sensors Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
[**Accelerometers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration, as a vector quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes)
<br>
**GyroScope** maintains orientation along a axis so that the orientation is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum.
<br>
Accelerometer measures the directional movement of a device but will not be able to resolve its lateral orientation or tilt during that movement accurately unless a gyro is there to fill in that info.
<br>
With an accelerometer you can either get a really "noisy" info output that is responsive, or you can get a "clean" output that's sluggish. But when you combine the 3-axis accelerometer with a 3-axis gyro, you get an output that is both clean and responsive in the same time.
